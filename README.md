### Feature 2 

We will create login/sign in page for customers, once they sign in they'll be added to the systems database.

We will create the contact form, which allows the customers to ask questions/give feedback or suggestions to the company. The customers as well as information they provided will be added to the database.

We will create adoption form for adopting your dream cat. Once the customer fills up the form, the cat will be moved to "Adopted" table in the database.

### Feature 6  

We will program banners on the home page to change every specified number of seconds, providing diverse information for our customers and creating a unique design for our page.

### Feature 7

We will make the search button interactive and working, and also make it slide out once a customer clicks on it.

### Feature 8

We will make a slide out menu in our header. The concept is to make it look more mobile user-friendly.

### Feature 9

We will make the 'random cat button' generate a random cat page every time a customer clicks on it, making it easier for the customer if they have any trouble deciding on which cat to choose.
